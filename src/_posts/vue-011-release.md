After the long wait, [Vue.js 0.11 **Cowboy Bebop**](https://github.com/yyx990803/vue/releases/tag/0.11.0) is finally here! Thanks to everyone who tried out the release candidate versions and provided feedback / bug reports along the way.

<!-- more -->

The 0.11 release introduced many new features and also a fair number of breaking changes, so please carefully read through the [0.11 Change List](https://github.com/yyx990803/vue/blob/master/changes.md) before upgrading. Aside from the API changes, 0.11 also ships with better [code quality](https://codeclimate.com/github/yyx990803/vue) and [test coverage](https://coveralls.io/r/yyx990803/vue), and is considerably more robust in almost every aspect.

This documentation site has been fully upgraded to match the new 0.11 API. For the now legacy 0.10.6 version, you can still find documentations for it at [legacy.vuejs.org](http://legacy.vuejs.org).
