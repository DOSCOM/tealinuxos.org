### Set up Firewall

Firewalls help prevent security breaches by blocking connections from unknown sources. In the initial conditions Firewall is not running but you can install applications like Firestarter or others.

### Be wary of accessing the internet

Here are some tips for keeping safe online:

-    Never reply to unsolicited email (spam, fraud or phishing email) or click on a link in an email. Usually you will be sent more spam email if clicking link in email.
-    Never click on links in emails asking for your password or other confidential information. This allows you to point to open addresses (possibly dangerous). Instead, type a link directly into your own web browser and proceed from there.
-    If a website asks for your financial details, make sure that it is secure. In the Firefox web browser, the secure site has a lock icon to the left of the address. Click on the padlock to read more information about website security.
-    Just download and run software from sources you trust.


### Backup data regularly

Possible problems are loss of files or data due to settings for one reason or another. The causes of data loss are numerous and varied; eg during a power failure to accidentally delete a file. It is strongly recommended that you backup your important files, if you encounter the problem, you still have the backup.

We recommend storing backups of files separately from your computer; such as CDs and DVDs, external hard disks, USB disks or other computers.

The easiest way to back up files is to manually copy them to a secure location using File Browser and Archive Manager to compress files and wrap those files. Alternatively, you can use a special backup application.

Tips when backing up data:

-   Back up regularly
-   Make sure it's made correctly
-   Label the backup clearly and keep it in a safe place
